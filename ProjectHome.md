Cdec is designed to gain a balance of Developing Performance versus Run-time Performance. In Cdec, your code style would be like Java and C# (excepting advanced language features), while it's truly pure C++ code without any modification on pre-processor and/or compiler. And also, we're building a cross-platform library around it. By the way, it's a light project. We don't want it to be very complex and heavy.
